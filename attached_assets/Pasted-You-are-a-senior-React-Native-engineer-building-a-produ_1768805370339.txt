You are a senior React Native engineer building a production-ready mobile app using React Native + React Navigation.

⚠️ IMPORTANT:
The app MUST start with an onboarding flow.
Home screen should only appear after onboarding is completed.

App Flow (Mandatory Order)

Onboarding Screens (First Launch Only)

Home Screen (Card List)

Card Details Screen

Add Card Screen

1️⃣ Onboarding Flow

Use 3 onboarding screens (can be swipe-based or button-based).

Each screen should have:

Title

Subtitle

Illustration placeholder

Last onboarding screen must have a “Get Started” button.

On clicking Get Started:

Save onboardingCompleted = true in local state (or AsyncStorage mock).

Navigate to Home Screen.

⚠️ On app reload:

If onboardingCompleted === true → go directly to Home Screen

Else → show Onboarding

2️⃣ Home Screen (Cards Screen)

This is the main screen after onboarding.

Display a list of user cards in a card-style layout.

Each card must be:

Clickable

Navigate to Card Details Screen

Show on each card:

Card image

Bank name

Card type (Credit / Debit)

Add a floating "+" button on this screen.

On clicking "+", navigate to Add Card Screen.

3️⃣ Card Details Screen

Show:

Card image

Bank name

Card type

No sensitive card data.

4️⃣ Add Card Screen (No Sensitive Data)

⚠️ Do NOT collect or store:

Card number

CVV

Expiry date

User selects only:

Bank

Example: HDFC, ICICI, Axis, SBI

Card type

Credit / Debit

Card from predefined list

Show card image (e.g., HDFC Infinia sample card)

On submit:

Add selected card to Home Screen list (local state only)

5️⃣ Navigation Structure (IMPORTANT)

Use React Navigation

Root Navigator:

Conditional navigation based on onboardingCompleted

Navigators:

OnboardingStack

MainStack

6️⃣ Data Handling

Use mock/static data for:

Bank list

Card list

Card images

Use Context API or useState for card state.

7️⃣ UI Expectations

Modern, clean UI

Rounded cards with shadows

Proper spacing and typography

Touchable feedback on press

8️⃣ Code Expectations

Functional components only

Hooks-based state

Modular folder structure

Clear comments

Complete runnable code

Output complete React Native code, including:

Navigation setup

Onboarding screens

Home screen with cards

Card details screen

Add card screen

Mock data

Basic styling

Assume this is an Expo-based project.
